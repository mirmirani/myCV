Hello,\
 \
This is my first complete project whilst learning programming.\
I used HTML, CSS and Javascript with the web framework w3.css to make this site, which is an online CV.\
I also researched and made use of UX principles, for example notice the effective use of contrasts, colours, and spaces.\
I hope to upload more projects soon, God willing 
\
\
Hope you are having a nice day.
\
Kind regards
\
